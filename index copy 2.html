 				<h2 id="what">What is a Basenji?</h2>
 					<p>A <strong>Basenji</strong> dog breed was originally found out of <em>Africa</em> in the <em>Congo.</em> 
 			        He uses both scent and sight to hunt and was originally used to 
 			        flush small game into a hunter's nets and to control village 
 			        rodent populations. 
 			        <br />
 			        
 				   <p>The Basenjis are amongst the oldest dogs of the World. The name Basenji means "small wild thing 
 				   from the bush", which sounds in the language of the Pygmies like "Basenji". This indicates already 
 				   the origin in Central Africa, that stretched from the heart of the Congo Basin to South Sudan. 
 				   The Basenjis lived there for thousands of years in a close relationship with the natives e.g.
 				   the Pygmy tribes. Normally the dogs lived as an independent pack near to the villages and supported
 				   themselves as a rule <em>(dependant on the tribe culture)</em>. Also reproduction took place for thousands of 
 				   years without any special control from humans.</p>
 				  <br />
 				  
 				  <h3 id="look">Basenji Appearance</h3>
 					  <p>A<strong> Basenji</strong> is a small, elegant-looking, short-haired dogs with erect ears, 
 				  	   a tightly curled tail and a graceful neck. A basenji's forehead is wrinkled, even more so 
 				  	   when they are young or extremely excited. A basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. 
 				  	  Basenjis typically weigh about <strong>9.1–10.9 kg (20–24 lb)</strong> and stand<strong> 41–46 cm (16–18 in)</strong>
 				  	  at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are as long as they are tall with males 
 				  	   usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their
 				       size. <br />  <br />They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground 
 				      in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater 
 				      balance when running flat out at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations:<em> 
 				      red, black, tricolor, and brindle,</em> and they all have white feet, chest and tail tip. 
 				      They can also come in trindle, which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination. </p>
 				   
 				   <h4 id="personality">Basenji Personality</h4>
 				   		<p>A <strong>Basenji</strong> is a hound. That means he's intelligent and independent, but also 
 				   		affectionate and alert. He's a sighthound, which means that motion catches his eye, and he'll
 				   		chase whatever he sees that moves — cats, squirrels, rabbits. He's not the kind of dog who will
 				   		obey commands instantly. He has to think about them and decide if he really wants to do what 
 				   		you've asked.<br /> 
 				   		<br />
 				        Patience and a sense of humor are essential to living with a Basenji. He will chew up or eat whatever's
 				         left in his reach, and he's quite capable of putting together a plan to achieve whatever it is he wants,
 				         whether that's to get up on the kitchen counter or break into the pantry where the dog biscuits are 
 				         stored. He can be aloof with strangers, and he shouldn't be trusted around cats or other small animals 
 				         unless he's been raised with them and you're sure he recognizes them as family members. That recognition 
 				         won't apply to cats or small animals he sees outdoors, however. They're fair game.<br />
 				         <br />
 				         A Basenji may know perfectly well all the commands you teach him, but whether he actually performs them 
 				         will always be in question. He may think first and then obey, or he may decide there's really 
 				         no good reason to do as you ask. Instead, Basenjis use their <strong>intelligence</strong> to demand your attention
 				        and get you to provide whatever it is they need or want.</p>
